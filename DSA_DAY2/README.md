#DrGViswanathan  Teaches Day Challenge
Welcome to my coding challenge repository! This repo contains my solutions for the #DrGViswanathan  Teaches day challenge, where I tackled fundamental programming problems to strengthen my problem-solving skills.
üéØ Challenge Overview
This challenge focuses on implementing clean, efficient solutions to classic coding problems. Each solution demonstrates different algorithmic approaches and data structure usage.
üìù Problems Solved
1. Two Sum (LeetCode #1)
Difficulty: Easy
Topic: Array, Hash Table
Given an array of integers nums and an integer target, return indices of the two numbers such that they add up to target.

Solution Approach: Use hash map to store number-to-index mapping
Two-pass algorithm: first pass stores all numbers, second pass finds complement
Handle duplicate indices with careful checking


Key Concepts:

Hash table for O(1) lookup
Time complexity: O(n)
Space complexity: O(n)

2. Find Numbers with Even Number of Digits (LeetCode #1295)
Difficulty: Easy
Topic: Array
Given an array nums of integers, return how many of them contain an even number of digits.

Solution Approach:Convert each number to string to easily count digits
Use modulo operator to check if digit count is even
Simple counter to track numbers with even digits


Key Concepts:

String conversion for digit counting
Modulo operation for even/odd checking
Time complexity: O(n * m) where m is average digits per number
